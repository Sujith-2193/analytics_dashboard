/**
 * Static data adapter for the public demo.
 *
 * The application is a normal FastAPI + PostgreSQL service and still runs that
 * way. The hosted demo is a build artifact of it: `backend/scripts/snapshot.py`
 * runs the real pipeline against a real database, trains the real models, and
 * freezes every API response to JSON. This module serves those files in place
 * of the network.
 *
 * The one hard problem is time. "Last 90 days" resolves against today's date,
 * so a snapshot taken on the 9th stops matching on the 10th and every request
 * misses. Rather than key the snapshot on presets and translate, this freezes
 * the clock: in static mode `today()` returns the date the snapshot was taken,
 * every preset resolves exactly as it did at build time, and the request path
 * can be used directly as the cache key with nothing in between to drift.
 *
 * Set VITE_STATIC_DATA=true to enable. Unset, every import here is inert and
 * the app talks to the API.
