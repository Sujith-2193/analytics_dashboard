"""API tests for the forecasting endpoints.

The regression these guard against is specific and real: this API used to
report model accuracy, MAPE, R², RMSE, churn risk scores, and confidence
intervals that were generated with `random.uniform()` rather than measured.
Several tests below assert that endpoint output matches the trained model
exactly, so any drift back toward fabrication fails the suite.
