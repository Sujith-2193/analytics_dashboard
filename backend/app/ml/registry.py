"""Model registry.

Training runs on first use and the result is cached for the process lifetime.
The dataset is a fixed synthetic corpus, so retraining per request would burn
CPU to produce the identical model.

Every accessor can return None. That is deliberate: when the data cannot
support a fit, callers must say the model is unavailable rather than fall back
to invented numbers. The whole point of this module is that a reader can trust
a reported metric came from a real evaluation.
